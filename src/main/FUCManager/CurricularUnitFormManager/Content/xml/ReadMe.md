# /XML

* This has an example of one possible xml document, that could be the output of the repository. This example has two Curricular Units for each of the 3 degrees of the DEETC, however it is possible generate one Curricular Unit for one degree following the exact same structure.
* This document is validated by template.dtd, which has the rules that make a valid xml document.
* In the future the validating schema should upgrade to an xsd structure, for better data control. Until then.
